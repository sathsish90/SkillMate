Don't make the mistake of applying to jobs online and then sitting back and waiting for something to happen. You have to be proactive. When you find a job lead of interest, do research to see if you are connected to anyone at the company.

If you are, reach out to that person and see if they will forward your resume to the hiring manager. If you don't know anyone personally, attempt to find the contact information for the hiring manager or someone closely tied to the role.

Remember, a proactive and personalized approach can significantly increase your chances of getting noticed and selected. Good luck!
